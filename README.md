Future Work: Separate the left and right sections of the force directed graph by 'sentiment', i.e. negative or positive. This will add meaning to the horizontal positioning of the nodes. The closer the node would be towards the edge, the greater the chance that it was framed with that sentiment. 

Special thanks to Jeffrey Heer and all of the CSE 442 TAs (Halden Lin, Younghoon Kim, Zening Qu, Sherry Wu)!
